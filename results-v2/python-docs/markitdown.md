## [Coroutines](#id2)[¶](#coroutines "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/asyncio/coroutines.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/asyncio/coroutines.py)

---

[Coroutines](../glossary.html#term-coroutine) declared with the async/await syntax is the
preferred way of writing asyncio applications. For example, the following
snippet of code prints “hello”, waits 1 second,
and then prints “world”:

```
>>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
```

Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to
be executed:

```
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
```

To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides the following mechanisms:

* The [`asyncio.run()`](asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") function to run the top-level
  entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)
* Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will
  print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world”
  after waiting for *another* 2 seconds:

  ```
  import asyncio
  import time

  async def say_after(delay, what):
      await asyncio.sleep(delay)
      print(what)

  async def main():
      print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

      await say_after(1, 'hello')
      await say_after(2, 'world')

      print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

  asyncio.run(main())
  ```

  Expected output:

  ```
  started at 17:13:52
  hello
  world
  finished at 17:13:55
  ```
* The [`asyncio.create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task") function to run coroutines
  concurrently as asyncio [`Tasks`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task").

  Let’s modify the above example and run two `say_after` coroutines
  *concurrently*:

  ```
  async def main():
      task1 = asyncio.create_task(
          say_after(1, 'hello'))

      task2 = asyncio.create_task(
          say_after(2, 'world'))

      print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

      # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
      # around 2 seconds.)
      await task1
      await task2

      print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
  ```

  Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs
  1 second faster than before:

  ```
  started at 17:14:32
  hello
  world
  finished at 17:14:34
  ```
* The [`asyncio.TaskGroup`](#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup") class provides a more modern
  alternative to [`create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task").
  Using this API, the last example becomes:

  ```
  async def main():
      async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
          task1 = tg.create_task(
              say_after(1, 'hello'))

          task2 = tg.create_task(
              say_after(2, 'world'))

          print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

      # The await is implicit when the context manager exits.

      print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
  ```

  The timing and output should be the same as for the previous version.

  Added in version 3.11: [`asyncio.TaskGroup`](#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup").

## [Awaitables](#id3)[¶](#awaitables "Link to this heading")

We say that an object is an **awaitable** object if it can be used
in an [`await`](../reference/expressions.html#await) expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to
accept awaitables.

There are three main types of *awaitable* objects:
**coroutines**, **Tasks**, and **Futures**.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are *awaitables* and therefore can be awaited from
other coroutines:

```
import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()  # will raise a "RuntimeWarning".

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
```

Important

In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for
two closely related concepts:

* a *coroutine function*: an [`async def`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) function;
* a *coroutine object*: an object returned by calling a
  *coroutine function*.

Tasks

*Tasks* are used to schedule coroutines *concurrently*.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a *Task* with functions like
[`asyncio.create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task") the coroutine is automatically
scheduled to run soon:

```
import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
```

Futures

A [`Future`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") is a special **low-level** awaitable object that
represents an **eventual result** of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is *awaited* it means that the coroutine will
wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code
to be used with async/await.

Normally **there is no need** to create Future objects at the
application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio
APIs, can be awaited:

```
async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
```

A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object
is [`loop.run_in_executor()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor "asyncio.loop.run_in_executor").

## [Creating tasks](#id4)[¶](#creating-tasks "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/asyncio/tasks.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/asyncio/tasks.py)

---

asyncio.create\_task(*coro*, *\**, *name=None*, *context=None*, *eager\_start=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#asyncio.create_task "Link to this definition")
:   Wrap the *coro* [coroutine](#coroutine) into a [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task")
    and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

    The full function signature is largely the same as that of the
    [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") constructor (or factory) - all of the keyword arguments to
    this function are passed through to that interface.

    An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a
    custom [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") for the *coro* to run in.
    The current context copy is created when no *context* is provided.

    An optional keyword-only *eager\_start* argument allows specifying
    if the task should execute eagerly during the call to create\_task,
    or be scheduled later. If *eager\_start* is not passed the mode set
    by [`loop.set_task_factory()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_task_factory "asyncio.loop.set_task_factory") will be used.

    The task is executed in the loop returned by [`get_running_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_running_loop "asyncio.get_running_loop"),
    [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") is raised if there is no running loop in
    current thread.

    Note

    [`asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task()`](#asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task "asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task") is a new alternative
    leveraging structural concurrency; it allows for waiting
    for a group of related tasks with strong safety guarantees.

    Important

    Save a reference to the result of this function, to avoid
    a task disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps
    weak references to tasks. A task that isn’t referenced elsewhere
    may get garbage collected at any time, even before it’s done.
    For reliable “fire-and-forget” background tasks, gather them in
    a collection:

    ```
    background_tasks = set()

    for i in range(10):
        task = asyncio.create_task(some_coro(param=i))

        # Add task to the set. This creates a strong reference.
        background_tasks.add(task)

        # To prevent keeping references to finished tasks forever,
        # make each task remove its own reference from the set after
        # completion:
        task.add_done_callback(background_tasks.discard)
    ```

    Added in version 3.7.

    Changed in version 3.8: Added the *name* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.11: Added the *context* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.14: Added the *eager\_start* parameter by passing on all *kwargs*.

## [Task cancellation](#id5)[¶](#task-cancellation "Link to this heading")

Tasks can easily and safely be cancelled.
When a task is cancelled, [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") will be raised
in the task at the next opportunity.

It is recommended that coroutines use `try/finally` blocks to robustly
perform clean-up logic. In case [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError")
is explicitly caught, it should generally be propagated when
clean-up is complete. `asyncio.CancelledError` directly subclasses
[`BaseException`](exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") so most code will not need to be aware of it.

The asyncio components that enable structured concurrency, like
[`asyncio.TaskGroup`](#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup") and [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout"),
are implemented using cancellation internally and might misbehave if
a coroutine swallows [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError"). Similarly, user code
should not generally call [`uncancel`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel").
However, in cases when suppressing `asyncio.CancelledError` is
truly desired, it is necessary to also call `uncancel()` to completely
remove the cancellation state.

## [Task groups](#id6)[¶](#task-groups "Link to this heading")

Task groups combine a task creation API with a convenient
and reliable way to wait for all tasks in the group to finish.

*class* asyncio.TaskGroup[¶](#asyncio.TaskGroup "Link to this definition")
:   An [asynchronous context manager](../reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers)
    holding a group of tasks.
    Tasks can be added to the group using [`create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task").
    All tasks are awaited when the context manager exits.

    Added in version 3.11.

    create\_task(*coro*, *\**, *name=None*, *context=None*, *eager\_start=None*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task "Link to this definition")
    :   Create a task in this task group.
        The signature matches that of [`asyncio.create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task").
        If the task group is inactive (e.g. not yet entered,
        already finished, or in the process of shutting down),
        we will close the given `coro`.

        Changed in version 3.13: Close the given coroutine if the task group is not active.

        Changed in version 3.14: Passes on all *kwargs* to [`loop.create_task()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task "asyncio.loop.create_task")

Example:

```
async def main():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        task1 = tg.create_task(some_coro(...))
        task2 = tg.create_task(another_coro(...))
    print(f"Both tasks have completed now: {task1.result()}, {task2.result()}")
```

The `async with` statement will wait for all tasks in the group to finish.
While waiting, new tasks may still be added to the group
(for example, by passing `tg` into one of the coroutines
and calling `tg.create_task()` in that coroutine).
Once the last task has finished and the `async with` block is exited,
no new tasks may be added to the group.

The first time any of the tasks belonging to the group fails
with an exception other than [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError"),
the remaining tasks in the group are cancelled.
No further tasks can then be added to the group.
At this point, if the body of the `async with` statement is still active
(i.e., [`__aexit__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") hasn’t been called yet),
the task directly containing the `async with` statement is also cancelled.
The resulting `asyncio.CancelledError` will interrupt an `await`,
but it will not bubble out of the containing `async with` statement.

Once all tasks have finished, if any tasks have failed
with an exception other than [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError"),
those exceptions are combined in an
[`ExceptionGroup`](exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") or [`BaseExceptionGroup`](exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup")
(as appropriate; see their documentation)
which is then raised.

Two base exceptions are treated specially:
If any task fails with [`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") or [`SystemExit`](exceptions.html#SystemExit "SystemExit"),
the task group still cancels the remaining tasks and waits for them,
but then the initial `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit`
is re-raised instead of [`ExceptionGroup`](exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") or [`BaseExceptionGroup`](exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup").

If the body of the `async with` statement exits with an exception
(so [`__aexit__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") is called with an exception set),
this is treated the same as if one of the tasks failed:
the remaining tasks are cancelled and then waited for,
and non-cancellation exceptions are grouped into an
exception group and raised.
The exception passed into `__aexit__()`,
unless it is [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError"),
is also included in the exception group.
The same special case is made for
[`KeyboardInterrupt`](exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") and [`SystemExit`](exceptions.html#SystemExit "SystemExit") as in the previous paragraph.

Task groups are careful not to mix up the internal cancellation used to
“wake up” their [`__aexit__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__aexit__ "object.__aexit__") with cancellation requests
for the task in which they are running made by other parties.
In particular, when one task group is syntactically nested in another,
and both experience an exception in one of their child tasks simultaneously,
the inner task group will process its exceptions, and then the outer task group
will receive another cancellation and process its own exceptions.

In the case where a task group is cancelled externally and also must
raise an [`ExceptionGroup`](exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup"), it will call the parent task’s
[`cancel()`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") method. This ensures that a
[`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") will be raised at the next
[`await`](../reference/expressions.html#await), so the cancellation is not lost.

Task groups preserve the cancellation count
reported by [`asyncio.Task.cancelling()`](#asyncio.Task.cancelling "asyncio.Task.cancelling").

Changed in version 3.13: Improved handling of simultaneous internal and external cancellations
and correct preservation of cancellation counts.

### Terminating a task group[¶](#terminating-a-task-group "Link to this heading")

While terminating a task group is not natively supported by the standard
library, termination can be achieved by adding an exception-raising task
to the task group and ignoring the raised exception:

```
import asyncio
from asyncio import TaskGroup

class TerminateTaskGroup(Exception):
    """Exception raised to terminate a task group."""

async def force_terminate_task_group():
    """Used to force termination of a task group."""
    raise TerminateTaskGroup()

async def job(task_id, sleep_time):
    print(f'Task {task_id}: start')
    await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)
    print(f'Task {task_id}: done')

async def main():
    try:
        async with TaskGroup() as group:
            # spawn some tasks
            group.create_task(job(1, 0.5))
            group.create_task(job(2, 1.5))
            # sleep for 1 second
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            # add an exception-raising task to force the group to terminate
            group.create_task(force_terminate_task_group())
    except* TerminateTaskGroup:
        pass

asyncio.run(main())
```

Expected output:

```
Task 1: start
Task 2: start
Task 1: done
```

## [Sleeping](#id7)[¶](#sleeping "Link to this heading")

*async* asyncio.sleep(*delay*, *result=None*)[¶](#asyncio.sleep "Link to this definition")
:   Block for *delay* seconds.

    If *result* is provided, it is returned to the caller
    when the coroutine completes.

    `sleep()` always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks
    to run.

    Setting the delay to 0 provides an optimized path to allow other
    tasks to run. This can be used by long-running functions to avoid
    blocking the event loop for the full duration of the function call.

    Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second
    for 5 seconds:

    ```
    import asyncio
    import datetime as dt

    async def display_date():
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
        while True:
            print(dt.datetime.now())
            if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
                break
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

    asyncio.run(display_date())
    ```

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.13: Raises [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if *delay* is [`nan`](math.html#math.nan "math.nan").

## [Running tasks concurrently](#id8)[¶](#running-tasks-concurrently "Link to this heading")

*awaitable* asyncio.gather(*\*aws*, *return\_exceptions=False*)[¶](#asyncio.gather "Link to this definition")
:   Run [awaitable objects](#asyncio-awaitables) in the *aws*
    sequence *concurrently*.

    If any awaitable in *aws* is a coroutine, it is automatically
    scheduled as a Task.

    If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an
    aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values
    corresponds to the order of awaitables in *aws*.

    If *return\_exceptions* is `False` (default), the first
    raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that
    awaits on `gather()`. Other awaitables in the *aws* sequence
    **won’t be cancelled** and will continue to run.

    If *return\_exceptions* is `True`, exceptions are treated the
    same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

    If `gather()` is *cancelled*, all submitted awaitables
    (that have not completed yet) are also *cancelled*.

    If any Task or Future from the *aws* sequence is *cancelled*, it is
    treated as if it raised [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") – the `gather()`
    call is **not** cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the
    cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other
    Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

    Note

    A new alternative to create and run tasks concurrently and
    wait for their completion is [`asyncio.TaskGroup`](#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup"). *TaskGroup*
    provides stronger safety guarantees than *gather* for scheduling a nesting of subtasks:
    if a task (or a subtask, a task scheduled by a task)
    raises an exception, *TaskGroup* will, while *gather* will not,
    cancel the remaining scheduled tasks.

    Example:

    ```
    import asyncio

    async def factorial(name, number):
        f = 1
        for i in range(2, number + 1):
            print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({number}), currently i={i}...")
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            f *= i
        print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")
        return f

    async def main():
        # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
        L = await asyncio.gather(
            factorial("A", 2),
            factorial("B", 3),
            factorial("C", 4),
        )
        print(L)

    asyncio.run(main())

    # Expected output:
    #
    #     Task A: Compute factorial(2), currently i=2...
    #     Task B: Compute factorial(3), currently i=2...
    #     Task C: Compute factorial(4), currently i=2...
    #     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
    #     Task B: Compute factorial(3), currently i=3...
    #     Task C: Compute factorial(4), currently i=3...
    #     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
    #     Task C: Compute factorial(4), currently i=4...
    #     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
    #     [2, 6, 24]
    ```

    Note

    If *return\_exceptions* is false, cancelling gather() after it
    has been marked done won’t cancel any submitted awaitables.
    For instance, gather can be marked done after propagating an
    exception to the caller, therefore, calling `gather.cancel()`
    after catching an exception (raised by one of the awaitables) from
    gather won’t cancel any other awaitables.

    Changed in version 3.7: If the *gather* itself is cancelled, the cancellation is
    propagated regardless of *return\_exceptions*.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if no positional arguments are provided
    or not all positional arguments are Future-like objects
    and there is no running event loop.

## [Eager task factory](#id9)[¶](#eager-task-factory "Link to this heading")

asyncio.eager\_task\_factory(*loop*, *coro*, *\**, *name=None*, *context=None*)[¶](#asyncio.eager_task_factory "Link to this definition")
:   A task factory for eager task execution.

    When using this factory (via [`loop.set_task_factory(asyncio.eager_task_factory)`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_task_factory "asyncio.loop.set_task_factory")),
    coroutines begin execution synchronously during [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") construction.
    Tasks are only scheduled on the event loop if they block.
    This can be a performance improvement as the overhead of loop scheduling
    is avoided for coroutines that complete synchronously.

    A common example where this is beneficial is coroutines which employ
    caching or memoization to avoid actual I/O when possible.

    Note

    Immediate execution of the coroutine is a semantic change.
    If the coroutine returns or raises, the task is never scheduled
    to the event loop. If the coroutine execution blocks, the task is
    scheduled to the event loop. This change may introduce behavior
    changes to existing applications. For example,
    the application’s task execution order is likely to change.

    Added in version 3.12.

asyncio.create\_eager\_task\_factory(*custom\_task\_constructor*)[¶](#asyncio.create_eager_task_factory "Link to this definition")
:   Create an eager task factory, similar to [`eager_task_factory()`](#asyncio.eager_task_factory "asyncio.eager_task_factory"),
    using the provided *custom\_task\_constructor* when creating a new task instead
    of the default [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task").

    *custom\_task\_constructor* must be a *callable* with the signature matching
    the signature of [`Task.__init__`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task").
    The callable must return a [`asyncio.Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task")-compatible object.

    This function returns a *callable* intended to be used as a task factory of an
    event loop via [`loop.set_task_factory(factory)`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_task_factory "asyncio.loop.set_task_factory")).

    Added in version 3.12.

## [Shielding from cancellation](#id10)[¶](#shielding-from-cancellation "Link to this heading")

*awaitable* asyncio.shield(*aw*)[¶](#asyncio.shield "Link to this definition")
:   Protect an [awaitable object](#asyncio-awaitables)
    from being [`cancelled`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel").

    If *aw* is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

    The statement:

    ```
    task = asyncio.create_task(something())
    res = await shield(task)
    ```

    is equivalent to:

    ```
    res = await something()
    ```

    *except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the
    Task running in `something()` is not cancelled. From the point
    of view of `something()`, the cancellation did not happen.
    Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression
    still raises a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError").

    If `something()` is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within
    itself) that would also cancel `shield()`.

    If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended)
    the `shield()` function should be combined with a try/except
    clause, as follows:

    ```
    task = asyncio.create_task(something())
    try:
        res = await shield(task)
    except CancelledError:
        res = None
    ```

    Important

    Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid
    a task disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps
    weak references to tasks. A task that isn’t referenced elsewhere
    may get garbage collected at any time, even before it’s done.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if *aw* is not Future-like object
    and there is no running event loop.

## [Timeouts](#id11)[¶](#timeouts "Link to this heading")

asyncio.timeout(*delay*)[¶](#asyncio.timeout "Link to this definition")
:   Return an [asynchronous context manager](../reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers)
    that can be used to limit the amount of time spent waiting on
    something.

    *delay* can either be `None`, or a float/int number of
    seconds to wait. If *delay* is `None`, no time limit will
    be applied; this can be useful if the delay is unknown when
    the context manager is created.

    In either case, the context manager can be rescheduled after
    creation using [`Timeout.reschedule()`](#asyncio.Timeout.reschedule "asyncio.Timeout.reschedule").

    Example:

    ```
    async def main():
        async with asyncio.timeout(10):
            await long_running_task()
    ```

    If `long_running_task` takes more than 10 seconds to complete,
    the context manager will cancel the current task and handle
    the resulting [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") internally, transforming it
    into a [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError") which can be caught and handled.

    Note

    The [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout") context manager is what transforms
    the [`asyncio.CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") into a [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError"),
    which means the `TimeoutError` can only be caught
    *outside* of the context manager.

    Example of catching [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError"):

    ```
    async def main():
        try:
            async with asyncio.timeout(10):
                await long_running_task()
        except TimeoutError:
            print("The long operation timed out, but we've handled it.")

        print("This statement will run regardless.")
    ```

    The context manager produced by [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout") can be
    rescheduled to a different deadline and inspected.

    *class* asyncio.Timeout(*when*)[¶](#asyncio.Timeout "Link to this definition")
    :   An [asynchronous context manager](../reference/datamodel.html#async-context-managers)
        for cancelling overdue coroutines.

        Prefer using [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout") or [`asyncio.timeout_at()`](#asyncio.timeout_at "asyncio.timeout_at")
        rather than instantiating `Timeout` directly.

        `when` should be an absolute time at which the context should time out,
        as measured by the event loop’s clock:

        * If `when` is `None`, the timeout will never trigger.
        * If `when < loop.time()`, the timeout will trigger on the next
          iteration of the event loop.

        > when() → [float](functions.html#float "float") | [None](constants.html#None "None")[¶](#asyncio.Timeout.when "Link to this definition")
        > :   Return the current deadline, or `None` if the current
        >     deadline is not set.
        >
        > reschedule(*when: [float](functions.html#float "float") | [None](constants.html#None "None")*)[¶](#asyncio.Timeout.reschedule "Link to this definition")
        > :   Reschedule the timeout.
        >
        > expired() → [bool](functions.html#bool "bool")[¶](#asyncio.Timeout.expired "Link to this definition")
        > :   Return whether the context manager has exceeded its deadline
        >     (expired).

    Example:

    ```
    async def main():
        try:
            # We do not know the timeout when starting, so we pass ``None``.
            async with asyncio.timeout(None) as cm:
                # We know the timeout now, so we reschedule it.
                new_deadline = get_running_loop().time() + 10
                cm.reschedule(new_deadline)

                await long_running_task()
        except TimeoutError:
            pass

        if cm.expired():
            print("Looks like we haven't finished on time.")
    ```

    Timeout context managers can be safely nested.

    Added in version 3.11.

asyncio.timeout\_at(*when*)[¶](#asyncio.timeout_at "Link to this definition")
:   Similar to [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout"), except *when* is the absolute time
    to stop waiting, or `None`.

    Example:

    ```
    async def main():
        loop = get_running_loop()
        deadline = loop.time() + 20
        try:
            async with asyncio.timeout_at(deadline):
                await long_running_task()
        except TimeoutError:
            print("The long operation timed out, but we've handled it.")

        print("This statement will run regardless.")
    ```

    Added in version 3.11.

*async* asyncio.wait\_for(*aw*, *timeout*)[¶](#asyncio.wait_for "Link to this definition")
:   Wait for the *aw* [awaitable](#asyncio-awaitables)
    to complete with a timeout.

    If *aw* is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

    *timeout* can either be `None` or a float or int number of seconds
    to wait for. If *timeout* is `None`, block until the future
    completes.

    If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises
    [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError").

    To avoid the task [`cancellation`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel"),
    wrap it in [`shield()`](#asyncio.shield "asyncio.shield").

    The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled,
    so the total wait time may exceed the *timeout*. If an exception
    happens during cancellation, it is propagated.

    If the wait is cancelled, the future *aw* is also cancelled.

    Example:

    ```
    async def eternity():
        # Sleep for one hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
        print('yay!')

    async def main():
        # Wait for at most 1 second
        try:
            await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
        except TimeoutError:
            print('timeout!')

    asyncio.run(main())

    # Expected output:
    #
    #     timeout!
    ```

    Changed in version 3.7: When *aw* is cancelled due to a timeout, `wait_for` waits
    for *aw* to be cancelled. Previously, it raised
    [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError") immediately.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.11: Raises [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError") instead of [`asyncio.TimeoutError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.TimeoutError "asyncio.TimeoutError").

## [Waiting primitives](#id12)[¶](#waiting-primitives "Link to this heading")

*async* asyncio.wait(*aws*, *\**, *timeout=None*, *return\_when=ALL\_COMPLETED*)[¶](#asyncio.wait "Link to this definition")
:   Run [`Future`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") and [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") instances in the *aws*
    iterable concurrently and block until the condition specified
    by *return\_when*.

    The *aws* iterable must not be empty.

    Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: `(done, pending)`.

    Usage:

    ```
    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
    ```

    *timeout* (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control
    the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

    Note that this function does not raise [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError").
    Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply
    returned in the second set.

    *return\_when* indicates when this function should return. It must
    be one of the following constants:

    | Constant | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | asyncio.FIRST\_COMPLETED[¶](#asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED "Link to this definition") | The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled. |
    | asyncio.FIRST\_EXCEPTION[¶](#asyncio.FIRST_EXCEPTION "Link to this definition") | The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to [`ALL_COMPLETED`](#asyncio.ALL_COMPLETED "asyncio.ALL_COMPLETED"). |
    | asyncio.ALL\_COMPLETED[¶](#asyncio.ALL_COMPLETED "Link to this definition") | The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled. |

    Unlike [`wait_for()`](#asyncio.wait_for "asyncio.wait_for"), `wait()` does not cancel the
    futures when a timeout occurs.

    If `wait()` is cancelled, the futures in *aws* are not cancelled
    and continue to run.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.11: Passing coroutine objects to `wait()` directly is forbidden.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added support for generators yielding tasks.

asyncio.as\_completed(*aws*, *\**, *timeout=None*)[¶](#asyncio.as_completed "Link to this definition")
:   Run [awaitable objects](#asyncio-awaitables) in the *aws* iterable
    concurrently. The returned object can be iterated to obtain the results
    of the awaitables as they finish.

    The object returned by `as_completed()` can be iterated as an
    [asynchronous iterator](../glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator) or a plain [iterator](../glossary.html#term-iterator). When asynchronous
    iteration is used, the originally-supplied awaitables are yielded if they
    are tasks or futures. This makes it easy to correlate previously-scheduled
    tasks with their results. Example:

    ```
    ipv4_connect = create_task(open_connection("127.0.0.1", 80))
    ipv6_connect = create_task(open_connection("::1", 80))
    tasks = [ipv4_connect, ipv6_connect]

    async for earliest_connect in as_completed(tasks):
        # earliest_connect is done. The result can be obtained by
        # awaiting it or calling earliest_connect.result()
        reader, writer = await earliest_connect

        if earliest_connect is ipv6_connect:
            print("IPv6 connection established.")
        else:
            print("IPv4 connection established.")
    ```

    During asynchronous iteration, implicitly-created tasks will be yielded for
    supplied awaitables that aren’t tasks or futures.

    When used as a plain iterator, each iteration yields a new coroutine that
    returns the result or raises the exception of the next completed awaitable.
    This pattern is compatible with Python versions older than 3.13:

    ```
    ipv4_connect = create_task(open_connection("127.0.0.1", 80))
    ipv6_connect = create_task(open_connection("::1", 80))
    tasks = [ipv4_connect, ipv6_connect]

    for next_connect in as_completed(tasks):
        # next_connect is not one of the original task objects. It must be
        # awaited to obtain the result value or raise the exception of the
        # awaitable that finishes next.
        reader, writer = await next_connect
    ```

    A [`TimeoutError`](exceptions.html#TimeoutError "TimeoutError") is raised if the timeout occurs before all awaitables
    are done. This is raised by the `async for` loop during asynchronous
    iteration or by the coroutines yielded during plain iteration.

    `as_completed()` does not cancel the tasks running the supplied
    awaitables: if a timeout occurs or the iteration is cancelled, the
    remaining tasks continue to run.

    Changed in version 3.10: Removed the *loop* parameter.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if not all awaitable objects in the *aws*
    iterable are Future-like objects and there is no running event loop.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added support for generators yielding tasks.

    Changed in version 3.13: The result can now be used as either an [asynchronous iterator](../glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator)
    or as a plain [iterator](../glossary.html#term-iterator) (previously it was only a plain iterator).

## [Running in threads](#id13)[¶](#running-in-threads "Link to this heading")

*async* asyncio.to\_thread(*func*, */*, *\*args*, *\*\*kwargs*)[¶](#asyncio.to_thread "Link to this definition")
:   Asynchronously run function *func* in a separate thread.

    Any \*args and \*\*kwargs supplied for this function are directly passed
    to *func*. Also, the current [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") is propagated,
    allowing context variables from the event loop thread to be accessed in the
    separate thread.

    Return a coroutine that can be awaited to get the eventual result of *func*.

    This coroutine function is primarily intended to be used for executing
    IO-bound functions/methods that would otherwise block the event loop if
    they were run in the main thread. For example:

    ```
    def blocking_io():
        print(f"start blocking_io at {time.strftime('%X')}")
        # Note that time.sleep() can be replaced with any blocking
        # IO-bound operation, such as file operations.
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"blocking_io complete at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    async def main():
        print(f"started main at {time.strftime('%X')}")

        await asyncio.gather(
            asyncio.to_thread(blocking_io),
            asyncio.sleep(1))

        print(f"finished main at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    asyncio.run(main())

    # Expected output:
    #
    # started main at 19:50:53
    # start blocking_io at 19:50:53
    # blocking_io complete at 19:50:54
    # finished main at 19:50:54
    ```

    Directly calling `blocking_io()` in any coroutine would block the event loop
    for its duration, resulting in an additional 1 second of run time. Instead,
    by using `asyncio.to_thread()`, we can run it in a separate thread without
    blocking the event loop.

    Note

    Due to the [GIL](../glossary.html#term-GIL), `asyncio.to_thread()` can typically only be used
    to make IO-bound functions non-blocking. However, for extension modules
    that release the GIL or alternative Python implementations that don’t
    have one, `asyncio.to_thread()` can also be used for CPU-bound functions.

    Added in version 3.9.

## [Scheduling from other threads](#id14)[¶](#scheduling-from-other-threads "Link to this heading")

asyncio.run\_coroutine\_threadsafe(*coro*, *loop*)[¶](#asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe "Link to this definition")
:   Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

    Return a [`concurrent.futures.Future`](concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Future "concurrent.futures.Future") to wait for the result
    from another OS thread.

    This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread
    than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

    ```
    def in_thread(loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop) -> None:
        # Run some blocking IO
        pathlib.Path("example.txt").write_text("hello world", encoding="utf8")

        # Create a coroutine
        coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

        # Submit the coroutine to a given loop
        future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

        # Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
        assert future.result(timeout=2) == 3

    async def amain() -> None:
        # Get the running loop
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

        # Run something in a thread
        await asyncio.to_thread(in_thread, loop)
    ```

    It’s also possible to run the other way around. Example:

    ```
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def loop_in_thread() -> Generator[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop]:
        loop_fut = concurrent.futures.Future[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop]()
        stop_event = asyncio.Event()

        async def main() -> None:
            loop_fut.set_result(asyncio.get_running_loop())
            await stop_event.wait()

        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(1) as tpe:
            complete_fut = tpe.submit(asyncio.run, main())
            for fut in concurrent.futures.as_completed((loop_fut, complete_fut)):
                if fut is loop_fut:
                    loop = loop_fut.result()
                    try:
                        yield loop
                    finally:
                        loop.call_soon_threadsafe(stop_event.set)
                else:
                    fut.result()

    # Create a loop in another thread
    with loop_in_thread() as loop:
        # Create a coroutine
        coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

        # Submit the coroutine to a given loop
        future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

        # Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
        assert future.result(timeout=2) == 3
    ```

    If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future
    will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in
    the event loop:

    ```
    try:
        result = future.result(timeout)
    except TimeoutError:
        print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
        future.cancel()
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
    else:
        print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
    ```

    See the [concurrency and multithreading](asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-multithreading)
    section of the documentation.

    Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the *loop*
    argument to be passed explicitly.

    Added in version 3.5.1.

## [Introspection](#id15)[¶](#introspection "Link to this heading")

asyncio.current\_task(*loop=None*)[¶](#asyncio.current_task "Link to this definition")
:   Return the currently running [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") instance, or `None` if
    no task is running.

    If *loop* is `None` [`get_running_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_running_loop "asyncio.get_running_loop") is used to get
    the current loop.

    Added in version 3.7.

asyncio.all\_tasks(*loop=None*)[¶](#asyncio.all_tasks "Link to this definition")
:   Return a set of not yet finished [`Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") objects run by
    the loop.

    If *loop* is `None`, [`get_running_loop()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_running_loop "asyncio.get_running_loop") is used for getting
    current loop.

    Added in version 3.7.

asyncio.iscoroutine(*obj*)[¶](#asyncio.iscoroutine "Link to this definition")
:   Return `True` if *obj* is a coroutine object.

    Added in version 3.4.

## [Task object](#id16)[¶](#task-object "Link to this heading")

*class* asyncio.Task(*coro*, *\**, *loop=None*, *name=None*, *context=None*, *eager\_start=False*)[¶](#asyncio.Task "Link to this definition")
:   A [`Future-like`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") object that runs a Python
    [coroutine](#coroutine). Not thread-safe.

    Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops.
    If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends
    the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion
    of the Future. When the Future is *done*, the execution of
    the wrapped coroutine resumes.

    Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs
    one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a
    Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs
    IO operations.

    Use the high-level [`asyncio.create_task()`](#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task") function to create
    Tasks, or the low-level [`loop.create_task()`](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task "asyncio.loop.create_task") or
    [`ensure_future()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.ensure_future "asyncio.ensure_future") functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks
    is discouraged.

    To cancel a running Task use the [`cancel()`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") method. Calling it
    will cause the Task to throw a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception into
    the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future
    object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

    [`cancelled()`](#asyncio.Task.cancelled "asyncio.Task.cancelled") can be used to check if the Task was cancelled.
    The method returns `True` if the wrapped coroutine did not
    suppress the [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception and was actually
    cancelled.

    [`asyncio.Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") inherits from [`Future`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future "asyncio.Future") all of its
    APIs except [`Future.set_result()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.set_result "asyncio.Future.set_result") and
    [`Future.set_exception()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.set_exception "asyncio.Future.set_exception").

    An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a
    custom [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") for the *coro* to run in.
    If no *context* is provided, the Task copies the current context
    and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

    An optional keyword-only *eager\_start* argument allows eagerly starting
    the execution of the [`asyncio.Task`](#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") at task creation time.
    If set to `True` and the event loop is running, the task will start
    executing the coroutine immediately, until the first time the coroutine
    blocks. If the coroutine returns or raises without blocking, the task
    will be finished eagerly and will skip scheduling to the event loop.

    Tasks are [generic](typing.html#generics) over the return type of their wrapped
    coroutines.

    Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the [`contextvars`](contextvars.html#module-contextvars "contextvars: Context Variables") module.

    Changed in version 3.8: Added the *name* parameter.

    Deprecated since version 3.10: Deprecation warning is emitted if *loop* is not specified
    and there is no running event loop.

    Changed in version 3.11: Added the *context* parameter.

    Changed in version 3.12: Added the *eager\_start* parameter.

    done()[¶](#asyncio.Task.done "Link to this definition")
    :   Return `True` if the Task is *done*.

        A Task is *done* when the wrapped coroutine either returned
        a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

    result()[¶](#asyncio.Task.result "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the result of the Task.

        If the Task is *done*, the result of the wrapped coroutine
        is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that
        exception is re-raised.)

        If the Task has been *cancelled*, this method raises
        a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception.

        If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises
        an [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") exception.

    exception()[¶](#asyncio.Task.exception "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the exception of the Task.

        If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception
        is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally
        this method returns `None`.

        If the Task has been *cancelled*, this method raises a
        [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception.

        If the Task isn’t *done* yet, this method raises an
        [`InvalidStateError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.InvalidStateError "asyncio.InvalidStateError") exception.

    add\_done\_callback(*callback*, *\**, *context=None*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.add_done_callback "Link to this definition")
    :   Add a callback to be run when the Task is *done*.

        This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

        See the documentation of [`Future.add_done_callback()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.add_done_callback "asyncio.Future.add_done_callback")
        for more details.

    remove\_done\_callback(*callback*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.remove_done_callback "Link to this definition")
    :   Remove *callback* from the callbacks list.

        This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

        See the documentation of [`Future.remove_done_callback()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback "asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback")
        for more details.

    get\_stack(*\**, *limit=None*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.get_stack "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

        If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack
        where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed
        successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list.
        If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns
        the list of traceback frames.

        The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

        Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

        The optional *limit* argument sets the maximum number of frames
        to return; by default all available frames are returned.
        The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether
        a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a
        stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are
        returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

    print\_stack(*\**, *limit=None*, *file=None*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.print_stack "Link to this definition")
    :   Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

        This produces output similar to that of the traceback module
        for the frames retrieved by [`get_stack()`](#asyncio.Task.get_stack "asyncio.Task.get_stack").

        The *limit* argument is passed to [`get_stack()`](#asyncio.Task.get_stack "asyncio.Task.get_stack") directly.

        The *file* argument is an I/O stream to which the output
        is written; by default output is written to [`sys.stdout`](sys.html#sys.stdout "sys.stdout").

    get\_coro()[¶](#asyncio.Task.get_coro "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the coroutine object wrapped by the `Task`.

        Note

        This will return `None` for Tasks which have already
        completed eagerly. See the [Eager Task Factory](#eager-task-factory).

        Added in version 3.8.

        Changed in version 3.12: Newly added eager task execution means result may be `None`.

    get\_context()[¶](#asyncio.Task.get_context "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the [`contextvars.Context`](contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") object
        associated with the task.

        Added in version 3.12.

    get\_name()[¶](#asyncio.Task.get_name "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the name of the Task.

        If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default
        asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during
        instantiation.

        Added in version 3.8.

    set\_name(*value*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.set_name "Link to this definition")
    :   Set the name of the Task.

        The *value* argument can be any object, which is then
        converted to a string.

        In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible
        in the [`repr()`](functions.html#repr "repr") output of a task object.

        Added in version 3.8.

    cancel(*msg=None*)[¶](#asyncio.Task.cancel "Link to this definition")
    :   Request the Task to be cancelled.

        If the Task is already *done* or *cancelled*, return `False`,
        otherwise, return `True`.

        The method arranges for a [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception to be thrown
        into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

        The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the
        request by suppressing the exception with a [`try`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#try) …
        … `except CancelledError` … [`finally`](../reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) block.
        Therefore, unlike [`Future.cancel()`](asyncio-future.html#asyncio.Future.cancel "asyncio.Future.cancel"), `Task.cancel()` does
        not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although
        suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively
        discouraged. Should the coroutine nevertheless decide to suppress
        the cancellation, it needs to call [`Task.uncancel()`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel") in addition
        to catching the exception.

        Changed in version 3.9: Added the *msg* parameter.

        Changed in version 3.11: The `msg` parameter is propagated from cancelled task to its awaiter.

        The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept
        the cancellation request:

        ```
        async def cancel_me():
            print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

            try:
                # Wait for 1 hour
                await asyncio.sleep(3600)
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
                raise
            finally:
                print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

        async def main():
            # Create a "cancel_me" Task
            task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

            # Wait for 1 second
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

            task.cancel()
            try:
                await task
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

        asyncio.run(main())

        # Expected output:
        #
        #     cancel_me(): before sleep
        #     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
        #     cancel_me(): after sleep
        #     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
        ```

    cancelled()[¶](#asyncio.Task.cancelled "Link to this definition")
    :   Return `True` if the Task is *cancelled*.

        The Task is *cancelled* when the cancellation was requested with
        [`cancel()`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") and the wrapped coroutine propagated the
        [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") exception thrown into it.

    uncancel()[¶](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "Link to this definition")
    :   Decrement the count of cancellation requests to this Task.

        Returns the remaining number of cancellation requests.

        Note that once execution of a cancelled task completed, further
        calls to `uncancel()` are ineffective.

        Added in version 3.11.

        This method is used by asyncio’s internals and isn’t expected to be
        used by end-user code. In particular, if a Task gets successfully
        uncancelled, this allows for elements of structured concurrency like
        [Task groups](#taskgroups) and [`asyncio.timeout()`](#asyncio.timeout "asyncio.timeout") to continue running,
        isolating cancellation to the respective structured block.
        For example:

        ```
        async def make_request_with_timeout():
            try:
                async with asyncio.timeout(1):
                    # Structured block affected by the timeout:
                    await make_request()
                    await make_another_request()
            except TimeoutError:
                log("There was a timeout")
            # Outer code not affected by the timeout:
            await unrelated_code()
        ```

        While the block with `make_request()` and `make_another_request()`
        might get cancelled due to the timeout, `unrelated_code()` should
        continue running even in case of the timeout. This is implemented
        with `uncancel()`. [`TaskGroup`](#asyncio.TaskGroup "asyncio.TaskGroup") context managers use
        [`uncancel()`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel") in a similar fashion.

        If end-user code is, for some reason, suppressing cancellation by
        catching [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError"), it needs to call this method to remove
        the cancellation state.

        When this method decrements the cancellation count to zero,
        the method checks if a previous [`cancel()`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") call had arranged
        for [`CancelledError`](asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError "asyncio.CancelledError") to be thrown into the task.
        If it hasn’t been thrown yet, that arrangement will be
        rescinded (by resetting the internal `_must_cancel` flag).

    Changed in version 3.13: Changed to rescind pending cancellation requests upon reaching zero.

    cancelling()[¶](#asyncio.Task.cancelling "Link to this definition")
    :   Return the number of pending cancellation requests to this Task, i.e.,
        the number of calls to [`cancel()`](#asyncio.Task.cancel "asyncio.Task.cancel") less the number of
        [`uncancel()`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel") calls.

        Note that if this number is greater than zero but the Task is
        still executing, [`cancelled()`](#asyncio.Task.cancelled "asyncio.Task.cancelled") will still return `False`.
        This is because this number can be lowered by calling [`uncancel()`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel"),
        which can lead to the task not being cancelled after all if the
        cancellation requests go down to zero.

        This method is used by asyncio’s internals and isn’t expected to be
        used by end-user code. See [`uncancel()`](#asyncio.Task.uncancel "asyncio.Task.uncancel") for more details.

        Added in version 3.11.
